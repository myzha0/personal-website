I am an incoming Assistant Professor (starting August 2025) of [Computer Science](https://www.colorado.edu/cs/) at the [University of Colorado Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu).

I build computer systems for machine learning pipelines that train and deploy large-scale ML models.
My research focuses on co-designing the many interacting systems underlying modern ML pipelines to improve their scalability, efficiency, and security.
My interests span the computing stack -- including systems, databases, architecture, and security -- and their intersection with machine learning.

I completed my Ph.D. in [Electrical Engineering](https://ee.stanford.edu) at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu), advised by [Christos Kozyrakis](https://web.stanford.edu/~kozyraki/).
I was a Visiting Researcher in the [FAIR](https://ai.meta.com/research/) and infrastructure teams at Meta from 2020-2022, where I designed and optimized data storage and ingestion infrastructure for Meta's machine learning training pipelines.
I received my B.S. in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.cornell.edu/ece) from [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu), where I worked with [Ed Suh](https://tsg.ece.cornell.edu/people/g-edward-suh/).

<span style="color: red;">**Prospective Students:**</span> I have multiple PhD openings in my group.
I am also looking for motivated graduate students and undergraduate researchers at CU Boulder.
If you are interested in working with me, please send me an email with your CV.
