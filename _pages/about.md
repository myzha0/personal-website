I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in [Electrical Engineering](https://ee.stanford.edu) at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu), advised by [Christos Kozyrakis](https://web.stanford.edu/~kozyraki/).

My research centers around building performant and scalable **systems for machine learning** to train, serve, and enable applications with large machine learning models.
I am broadly interested in applying tools across distributed systems, networking, storage, databases, security, and computer architecture.
<!---My research centers around designing systems to improve the scalability, performance, and security of datacenter-scale applications such as machine learning.
I am currently building systems that enable large-scale machine learning training and serving pipelines.
My prior research has explored accelerating video analytics pipelines and the security of cloud FPGAs.-->
My research won the [IEEE S&P Distinguished Practical Paper Award](https://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2018/awards.html) and is a [Top Pick in Hardware and Embedded Security](https://www.ieee-hsttc.org/top-picks-2022/).
I am grateful to have been selected as an [MLCommons Rising Star](https://mlcommons.org/2023/07/introducing-the-2023-mlcommons-rising-stars/).
My work is generously supported by a [Stanford Graduate Fellowship](https://vpge.stanford.edu/fellowships-funding/sgf/details) and a [Meta Ph.D. Fellowship](https://research.facebook.com/fellowship/) in AI System HW/SW Co-Design.

I was recently a Visiting Researcher in the [FAIR](https://ai.facebook.com) and infrastructure teams at Meta from 2020-2022, where I designed and optimized data storage and ingestion infrastructure for Meta's machine learning training pipelines.
I received my B.S. in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.cornell.edu/ece) from [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu) in 2018, where I worked with [Ed Suh](https://tsg.ece.cornell.edu/people/g-edward-suh/) on hardware security.
